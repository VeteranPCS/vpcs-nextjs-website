          If you are looking to sell your home within the year, there is a cost to refi. A competent lender is going to run the break even point for you to ensure you aren&apos;t doing something that doesn&apos;t benefit you. Don&apos;t chase the rate. Make sure you understand the cost of the refi divided by the savings in the rate to ensure it is worth it for you!
