          The VA Streamline IRRRL (Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan) is a simplified way to drop your mortgage rate to a lower fee. The process is streamlined and requires less paperwork than a purchase. The closing timelines are usually 10-14 business days. It is streamlined because it requires no income and asset verification, no appraisal, and has flexible eligibility requirements. The closing costs are rolled into the loan so there is no out of pocket cost.
