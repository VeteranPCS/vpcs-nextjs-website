          All fees can be rolled in on the VA Streamline IRRRL to include the VA Funding Fee of 0.5%. If you have a VA disability rating then the VA Funding Fee is waived. The other fees involved in the refi are typical credit report fees, title fees, and recording with the county. Some of our partners will waive the lender fee (usually an underwriting or processing fee). If you buy down your rate, then this is on top of the other fees as well. All of these fees can be rolled into your loan.
